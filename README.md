The Open FAIR Course project will provide instructor led material for anyone interested to conduct FAIR workshops. For example if you intend to introduce FAIR to colleagues.
The primary target group are FAIR enthusiast that are familiar with the official FAIR material from the Open Group and the Book "Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A FAIR Approach" by Jack Freund and Jack Jones. This is not a self-study material, allthough you might find something useful in it nonethelss.

This is now ver. 0.1. If there is general intest in the material then I will continue improving it.
